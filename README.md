# DisplayMessageOnAbacus

## Why does this exist?
I bought an old chinese abacus (the japanese kind are different) at a thrift store a while back and was looking for a cool way to make use of it. The abacus has been hung on my wall for over a year and I never put it to use. I decided to write a program that would turn an input string into a unique number and then output what the abacus would look like with that string encoded into it.

## Usage
This program will prompt the user for a phrase (valid inputs being letters and spaces) and output an ascii image of what the abacus should look like to display that image.
