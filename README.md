# DisplayMessageOnAbacus

## Why does this exist?
I bought an old chinese abacus at a thrift store a while back and was looking for a cool way to make use of it. I decided to write a program that would accept a string as input and return an ascii image of that message encrypted into the abacus. 

## Usage
This program will prompt the user for a phrase (valid inputs being letters and spaces) and output an ascii image of what the abacus should look like to display that phrase.
